# E-commerce

In this project I learn about RESTFull Architecture , Authentication and Autherization , built my familiarity with Express.
For this Project I chose MEN stack with vanilla JavaScript :
Mongodb -> [DataBase] : because of its Availability and Partition tolerance.
Express -> [Server] : //add one line here
Node.js -> [BackHand] :  //add one line here

for authentication i chose postman becase its a middleware that is highly excepted with node js
I use Embedded JavaScript for my frontend
I gained knowledge about mvc[models views controlles] archrcture

here is a breif about my project.
